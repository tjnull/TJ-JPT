## Session Defender
Villain has a function that inspects user issued shell commands for input that may cause a backdoor shell session to hang (e.g., unclosed single/double quotes or backticks, commands that may start a new interactive session within the current shell and more). Use the `cmdinspector` command to turn that feature on/off.  

Usage: 
```
cmdinspector <ON/OFF>
```
