## Remember:

- Check for kernel(*nix) or OS (windows) exploits.
- CHECK RUNNING SERVICES. What is installed and running on the target? Is there a local exploit available for that service? 
- Look for misconfigured file permissions (those checker scripts are great for this). Is there something readable/writiable to me that shouldn't be? For example: should I be able to write to a file owned by user/group root? Probably not. What about scheduled task/cron jobs? Can I use those somehow?
- Lastly, I just look around for any files that maybe have a password in them. Example: SQL/Apache config files. Did someone leave a password I could use here?
