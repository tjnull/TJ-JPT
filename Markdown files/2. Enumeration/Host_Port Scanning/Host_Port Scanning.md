# Host/Port Scanning

Once a list of hosts that are alive on the network have been identified, the next step is to identify the open ports on those hosts. If we're working with a large network, we don't want to do service enumeration just yet. By getting the open ports, we can identify low hanging fruit and identify potentially interesting hosts and ports.
