- `who`: show who is logged on
- `tty`: show current users pseudo terminal
- `ps -ft pts/1`: get process id for the pseudo terminal

1. Check active users logged into the server with: `w`
```
 16:53:37 up 23:46,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
debian   pts/1    24.69.132.96     16:45    0.00s  0.04s  0.00s w
debain   pts/2    24.69.132.96:S.0 16:35   16.00s  0.02s  0.02s /bin/bash
```
2. Get the PID (Process ID) of a connected terminal (tty) with: `ps -ft pts/1`
```
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
debian   28580 28102  0 16:45 pts/1    00:00:00 -bash
debian   29081 28580  0 16:55 pts/1    00:00:00 ps -ft pts/1
